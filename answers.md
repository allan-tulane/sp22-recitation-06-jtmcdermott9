- **1b.**

The asymptotic run time of qsort_fixed is O(n^2), the expected runtime of qsort_random is O(n). We see qsort_fixed follow its expected runtime, while qsort_random performs worse than we would expect, but performs better in some cases compared to qsort_fixed. Overall, the two are quite comparable.




- **1c.**
Timsort wildly outperforms both qsort_fixed and qsort_random. Timsort appears to grow logarithmically as a factor of the input size n,, much better than the previous examples.
